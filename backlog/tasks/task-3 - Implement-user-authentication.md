## Description

This task involves setting up user registration and login functionality. It will include creating the necessary API endpoints and frontend components for user authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can create a new account.
- [ ] Users can log in with their credentials.
- [ ] The system provides a way to manage user sessions.

## Implementation Plan

1.  Add `servant-auth` dependency to the API's `package.yaml`.
2.  Create an `Auth.hs` module to define authentication types and settings.
3.  Integrate `servant-auth` settings (JWT, cookies) into the main application.
4.  Add a password hashing library (`bcrypt`) to the project dependencies.
